# Task 1.4 (ref R4): Correlation matrix + gated branch interaction

This bundle validates:
- Predict correlation matrix `C` from pooled ligand/protein graph embeddings.
- Build a boolean branch-interaction mask from `C` and show it changes branch mixing stats.

Run:
- `bash run.sh` (macOS/Linux)
- `run.bat` (Windows)
